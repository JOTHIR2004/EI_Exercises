# Builder Pattern

## Purpose
The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows for creating different representations of an object using the same construction process.

## Files

- `Invoice.cs` : The final product class representing an Invoice.
- `InvoiceBuilder.cs` : Abstract builder defining the steps for creating an invoice.
- `Program.cs` : Entry point to run the Builder demo.
- `Builder.csproj` : Project file for the Builder pattern.

## Usage
Run `Program.cs` to see a demo of building invoices step by step, showcasing the flexibility of the Builder pattern.
