# Exercise 1 - Design Patterns

This project demonstrates **common C# design patterns**: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.  
Each pattern is in a **separate folder** with its own `Program.cs` file.

---

## Creational Patterns

**Builder Pattern**  
- Builds complex objects step by step.  
- *Use Case*: Invoice creation.  

**Factory Method Pattern**  
- Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic.  
- *Use Case*: Payment gateway (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer).  

---

## Structural Patterns

**Decorator Pattern**  
- Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.  
- *Use Case*: Coffee customization (milk, sugar).  

**Facade Pattern**  
- Simplifies access to a complex subsystem.  
- *Use Case*: Home Theater control.  

---

## Behavioral Patterns

**Memento Pattern**  
- Captures and restores object state.  
- *Use Case*: Undo/redo in a text editor.  

**Observer Pattern**  
- One-to-many dependency; observers notified automatically.  
- *Use Case*: College notifications, weather station updates.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.  
2. Navigate to the pattern folder.  
3. Run `Program.cs` to see the pattern in action.
