# Facade Pattern

## Purpose
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the internal complexities and provides a single entry point.

## Files

- `DVDPlayer.cs` : Subsystem class for the DVD player.
- `Projector.cs` : Subsystem class for the projector.
- `SoundSystem.cs` : Subsystem class for the sound system.
- `Lights.cs` : Subsystem class for room lights.
- `HomeTheaterFacade.cs` : Facade class combining all subsystems into a simplified interface.
- `Program.cs` : Entry point to run the Facade demo.
- `Facade.csproj` : Project file for the Facade pattern.

## Usage
Run `Program.cs` to simulate a home theater system using a single unified interface to start a movie.
