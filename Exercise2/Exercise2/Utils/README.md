# Utils Folder

Contains utility classes for **logging and input validation**.

### Files:

- `Logger.cs` → Logs device actions, scheduled tasks, and triggers
- `Validator.cs` → Validates user input (IDs, times, integers, etc.)

### Key Concepts Applied:

- **OOP:** Encapsulation (private methods and validation)
- **SOLID Principles:** SRP (single responsibility for each utility)
